# cs200CopyrightMuseum

I was in a group by myself, Matthew Harlan. 

It was imagined and developed all by myself as well. The journey begins with you entering the museum which is on the subject of copyright regarding technology and similar subjects. After you enter there is an “admission fee” that you have to pay in order to get in. There are a few initial subjects regarding copyright and even a few “jokes” along the way, but you have to see everything in order to exit the building. 

Here are the resources that I used:
